# WORK IN PROGRES!

## *Project Name:* **WebHub**

This repository is a part of the 3-repository project *WebHub*

This is the robot-client reposotory. It connects to the server to transmit the stream from the camera as well as receive and execute commands sent by the user.

This repository has two branches: one, *master*, primarily for testing with no support for the motors, and hence, fake command executioners, and another, *MotorIntegration*, which is intended for running on a Raspberry Pi, and which can properly execute all the commands.
